Behind a proxy?
No problem. You can download the wiki-js.tar.gz file directly from the GitHub Releases and place the archive to the root of the folder where Wiki.js should be installed (do not extract!). Then run the command above to complete the installation. The install script will use the local archive instead of downloading it from the internet.
Note that you must have preconfigured npm to use your proxy first, as dependencies are still fetching from the internet.
